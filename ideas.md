Teaching style/notes...

* You're at college to learn; I don't expect you to have been programming since you were 10 years old.
* Students should be building their portfolio throughout college - a GitHub is a good idea.
* Students should be learning to use some form of Version Control.
* As many resources as needed
* Students should understand that programming is cheap -- they don't need Visual Studio or even Windows to write C++ code
